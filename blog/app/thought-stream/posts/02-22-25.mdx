summary: 'why actions must be repeated and repeated and repeated to gain excellence'

I was reading through old twitter posts and stumbled upon an old post of mine, sharing a [blog post](https://humdaan.notion.site/Building-thoughts-on-pmarca-s-essay-4-18-432ca607a06a4dbab7726dc05461ea4b) . The writing isn't great but it's much more cohesive and thought through than anything non-engineering related I've written in recent times. At the time, I was doing an activity where my goal was to write some form of thoughts daily and publish them to this notion page(to which no one knew of its existence), in an effort to, well, write more. Lately, I've been meaning to get back into publishing my thoughts online, but have been struggling getting to a satisfactory point with (non-engineering) prose to share into the void. It clicked upon seeing my old writing, and the frequency at which I was writing, that this act can't be something that one picks up from time to time. It's a muscle. And Muscles atrophy.
The good news is, bodybuilders often refer to the phenomenon of muscle memory, in which when one takes an extended break from bodybuilding for some time and their muscle ends up atrophying, the rate of change to bring that muscle back to 95% of it's original physique is much faster than the original build to the 100%.
And I believe this to be true, not only for physical masses, but for all actions in general. Not just physical actions, like how much you can bench after a hiatus, or your sprint speed, but mental ones, such as writing, interpreting data, coming up with banger tweets, etc.
